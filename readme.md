![Challenge Outcome](/challange-assets/challenge-outcome.png)

---

**Challenge details:**

Backend:

* Create a REST service to be able to get, add, update, and delete cat appointments.
  * You can choose to create it in **Java** OR **NodeJS**.
  * You can use the backend/database.json as a database OR create your own in SQL or MongoDB.

  * If you chose to create it using **Java**, you must:
    * Use Spring Boot.

  * If you chose to create it using **NodeJS**, you must:
    * Use TypeScript
    * Use Express
    * Make it developer friendly, compiling the TypeScript in JavaScript when detecting changes on save.

Frontend:

* Inside the /frontend directory is an angular project
* To run it, run the following commands: `npm ci` and `npm start`.
* Create a service and the functionality necessary to retrieve the existing appointments and save a new appointment.
* Create the necessary components to:
  * Display the data of an appointment
  * Display the list of appointments
  * Take the user input and create a new appointment.
* Use RxJS.
* Use NgRx (optional)

**Rules:**
* You can search for solutions online. (Angular documentation, StackOverflow, etc)
* Implement the solution as you would implement a feature in a real project.

**How to deliver the solution:**
* Create a GitHub repo and send the link or archive the solution. (If you chose to send a zip file, delete the node_modules)
* Include both the frontend and backend solution in the same repo/archive.
* Add instructions on how to run the application, if needed.

**During the interview:**
* You'll have to demo the application and explain your thought process.
